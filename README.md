## **The C Programming Language Exercises** 



This repository contains a collection of exercises using the C language. The idea is to get a grasp of understanding of the language.

I will periodically add some exercises to this repository.

You can explore, fork and contribute to this repository. Feedback, suggestions and contributions are appreciated.

**Have fun while learning!**

ðŸ‘‰ Check the book _The C Programming Language_ for reference.
